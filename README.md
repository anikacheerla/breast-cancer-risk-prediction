These are a set of scripts that I used for the breast cancer risk prediction project. The image database camr from Stanford University. This method uses novel application of BOW approach for feature extraction and uses random forest classification to find risk prediction (future cancer occurrence after two years) from normal pre-cancerous mammograms
